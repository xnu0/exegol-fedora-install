#### 1. Install Requirements

1. Run DNF to update git, python3 and install pipx. 

```shell
sudo dnf -y update && sudo dnf -y install git python3 pipx
```

2. Ensure that pipx is already in PATH and reload the shell.

```shell
pipx ensurepath && exec $SHELL
```


> [!tip] Expected Output
> After running the command, you should see something like:
>
> ```shell
> /home/sithsec/.local/bin is already in PATH.
> 
> ⚠️  All pipx binary directories have been appended to PATH. If you are sure you want to proceed, try
> again with the '--force' flag.
> 
> Otherwise pipx is ready to go! ✨ 🌟 ✨
> ```


#### 2. Docker Engine installation using the rpm repository

Before installing Docker Engine for the first time, it is necessary to set up the Docker repository. 

1. Setting up the repository

```bash
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
```

```bash
sudo dnf-3 config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
```

2. Installing the latest Docker version

```bash
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

>  From       : https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/gpg
> Hit [Y] and proceed with the installation.
> ```


Hit [Y] and proceed with the installation. 


3. Start Docker Engine. 

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker 
```

> [!info] If you want that Docker systemd start automatically when booting the system:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

4. Verify if the installation was successful.

```shell
sudo docker run hello-world
```


> [!warning]
> Docker "Rootless mode" is not supported by Exegol as of yet. Don't follow that part.



### 3. Exegol Wrapper install

Install Exegol in an isolated environment using pipx, a tool that allows you to easily install and run Python applications in isolated environments, keeping them separate from your system Python and other packages.

1. Installing the wrapper with pipx
```shell
pipx install exegol
```


> [!tip] Expected Output After Installing the Wrapper
> After running `pipx install exegol`, you should see an output like:
>
> ```shell
>   installed package exegol 5.0.0, installed using Python 3.13.3
>   These apps are now globally available
>     - exegol
> done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
> ```



2. Testing if exegol wrapper was successfully installed

```shell
exegol info
```



> [!tip] Expected Output When Running `exegol info`
> When you run `exegol info` for the first time, you should see:
>
> ```shell
> [*] Exegol Community is currently in version v5.0.0
> [?] I confirm that I've read and accepted the EULA (https://docs.exegol.com/legal/eula) [y/N]:
> ```



> [!info]  Usage and Permissions Notice
> Before using Exegol, you must read and accept the [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://docs.exegol.com/legal/eula). This will be prompted on the first run of the wrapper and will continue until confirmed.
>
> To interact with Docker, the Exegol wrapper needs proper permissions. You must either:
> - Run Exegol with `sudo` (**preferred**, for security), or
> - Add your user to the `docker` group (⚠️ **less secure**, as it grants root-equivalent access).
>
> If you accept the [EULA](https://docs.exegol.com/legal/eula), press `Y` when prompted and proceed with the installation.



3. Creating a Shell Alias to Run Exegol with sudo

The following command shows how to do that with bash, but it can be adapted to any shell. Once the alias is set, you can apply it your current session.

###### Recommended method for fedora

1. Open ~/.bashrc

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Go to the final line of the ~/.bashrc file and add:


```shell
alias exegol='sudo -E ~/.local/bin/exegol'
```


Press [CTRL] + [O] to save, then [ENTER], and [CTRL] + [X] to exit.

3. Reload your shell to apply changes

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```



###### Alternative method (less recommended)

Fedora Workstation (version 42) **does not automatically load aliases from files like `~/.bash_aliases`** when starting a new terminal session.

If you still prefer this method, use:

For bash
```bash
echo "alias exegol='sudo -E $(echo ~/.local/bin/exegol)'" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases
```

For Zsh

```
echo "alias exegol='sudo -E $(echo ~/.local/bin/exegol)'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```



> [!tip] Alias Not Working?
> If you created the alias in `~/.bash_aliases` but it's not working in the terminal, it's likely because your `~/.bashrc` does **not include the line that sources `~/.bash_aliases`**.
>
> To fix this, make sure your `~/.bashrc` contains the following:
>
> ```bash
> if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
>     . ~/.bash_aliases
> fi
> ```
>
> After adding it, run:
>
> ```bash
> source ~/.bashrc
> ```
>
> Alternatively, you can add the alias directly to `~/.bashrc`, which works the same way and avoids this issue.



### 4. Activation 

When you start exegol for the first time, it should ask for an activation licence. If you have a [Pro or Enterprise subscription](https://exegol.com/pricing) you can activate your license.

Else, you can activate exegol at any moment with:

```shell
exegol activate
```

You will need an active license and a token from dashboard.exegol.com/otp. See the [activate documentation](https://docs.exegol.com/wrapper/cli/activate) section for more information on that action.



> [!tip] Expected Output When Activating Exegol
> After running `exegol activate`, the following output is expected:
>
> ```shell
> [?] Do you want to activate your Exegol subscription now? [y/N]: y
> [*] Authenticating to Exegol                                                                                                  
> [?] Enter your exegol email account: email@email.com
> [+] To link your account to the wrapper, you need to generate a login code from your dashboard:                               
> https://dashboard.exegol.com/otp                                                                                              
> [?] Enter your login token: 999999
> [+] Successfully authenticated                         
> ```


*If you don't have a license, you can still use the community version for non-professional use.


> [!warning]
> ⚠️ You can only have one active license per machine at a time.
> If you want to activate a different license, you must first revoke the current one using the `--revoke` option.


Revoke current license 

You can only use one license in one instance, but it's possible to revoke and reactivate into another machine or after formatting.

```shell
exegol activate --revoke
```

### 5. Image install

#### Proceed the installation

Once the wrapper is installed, you can download your first Exegol image:

```shell
exegol install
```

You'll be guided through selecting and installing an image.

> [!tip] Available Images Output
> When running `exegol install`, you will be prompted to select an image. The output should look like this:
>
> ```shell
> 🛸 Available images                           
> ┌─────────┬──────────┬───────────────────────┐
> │ Image   │ Size     │ Status                │
