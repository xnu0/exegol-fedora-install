#### Add your user to the `docker` group (⚠️ **less secure**, as it grants root-equivalent access).

If you find an error message, while running any exegol action (install, info, start), saying that you don't have permission to interact with docker:

```shell
[!] Docker is installed on your host but you don't have the permission to interact with it. Exiting.                           
```

 1. Add your user to `docker` group 

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

2. Activate docker group without reboot

```
newgrp docker
```

3. Test if the user has permissions now

```
docker ps
```

It should output 

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```
